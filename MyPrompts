prompt:
What is a class in JavaScript?

response:
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data with code to work on that data. Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a more structured and traditional way of handling object-oriented programming compared to the prototype-based approach that JavaScript originally used.

Here's a basic example of a JavaScript class:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }

  // Static Method
  static species() {
    console.log('Homo sapiens');
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Person class
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

// Calling a static method
Person.species(); // Output: Homo sapiens
```

In this example:

- `class Person` defines a class named `Person`.
- The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. In this case, it initializes the `name` and `age` properties.
- The `greet` method is a regular method that can be called on instances of the class.
- The `species` method is a static method that can be called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.
